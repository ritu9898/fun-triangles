# fun-triangles

As the name suggests, this website has different modules for triangles. It has a quiz section that has about ten questions for triangles. The project also asks for three angles and shows the result to the user whether the angles form a triangle or not. The site takes some data to calculate the area of a triangle. It also checks if the triangle is a hypotenuse.
